# personal-website
My personal website (in progress).

I will keep working on building my personal website in my free time. I expect to finish sometime in early 2016.
<hr />

UPDATE (Jan 10, 2016): I've finished building the site and am currently working on hosting. <br />
The domain name for my website will be: http://www.daocunyang.com <br /><br />
The file <a href="./server.js">server.js</a> is a light-weight server built in node.js (as I'm currently dabbling with node), that can be used to serve all the files and file types involved with my site.
