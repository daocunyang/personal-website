# personal-website
My personal website (in progress).

I will keep working on building my personal website in my free time. I expect to finish sometime in early 2016.
<hr />

UPDATE (Jan 10, 2016): I've finished building the site and am currently working on hosting. <br />
The domain name for my website will be: http://www.daocunyang.com <br /><br />
The file <a href="./server.js">server.js</a> is a light-weight server built in node.js (as I'm currently dabbling with node), that can be used to serve all the files and file types involved with my site.


UPDATE (Jan 13, 2016): Fixed the issue with responsiveness. Site has been fully up and running for two days. 

UPDATE (Feb 29, 2016): the service provided by freegeoip seems to be unstable. As a result I decided to switch to using ipinfo.io for detecting the origin of visitors.
